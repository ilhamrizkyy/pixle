/**
 * End-to-end tests for the composer (PLAN.md Phase 4).
 *
 * These exist for the one thing the Vitest suite structurally cannot reach:
 * POINTER PATHS. Drag-fill, pointer capture, second-tap clear and the
 * slide-to-clear wipe are the composer's core interaction, and jsdom has no
 * layout, so a synthetic pointerdown there proves only that a handler was
 * called — not that it was called with the cell the user was actually over.
 *
 * They run against a PRODUCTION BUILD, not the dev server. The dev overlay puts
 * a fixed indicator over the bottom-left of the viewport, which is exactly
 * where the toy's left knob sits; and dev-mode double-rendering hides the class
 * of bug where an effect runs twice. Testing what ships is worth the build.
 *
 * Port 3100 so a dev server on 3000 can stay up while these run.

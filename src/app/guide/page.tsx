 * The Guide.

 * Structured as reading, not as a grid of equal cards — four same-size boxes
 * of heading-plus-text flatten every rule to the same weight and explain
 * nothing that the words alone would not.
 *
 * Instead each rule is SHOWN with the product's own material: a real grid
 * diagram, real icons at every size, real recoloring. Every number is read
 * from engine constants, so the page cannot drift from the geometry it
 * documents.

              An icon <em>is</em> its cells — {GRID_SIZE}×{GRID_SIZE} of them on
              a {CANVAS_UNITS}-unit viewBox, four units per cell. The grid is
              odd on purpose, so there is an exact centre column and row to be
              symmetrical about. SVG and PNG are generated from the cells; the
              cells are never generated from the SVG.

              Art stays inside a {SAFE_AREA_SIZE}×{SAFE_AREA_SIZE} region, one
              cell in from every edge. {SAFE_AREA_SIZE} is the only inset that
              centres on an odd grid — a {SAFE_AREA_SIZE + 1}-wide area would
              leave a single cell of margin to split between two sides. The
              margin is a guide, not a fence: the composer will let you draw to
              the edge when a glyph needs it.

              masses. An envelope whose flap only exists as a lighter interior
              becomes a rectangle the moment one color is applied; an outlined
              one survives.

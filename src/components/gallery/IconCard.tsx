 * One icon in the grid.

 * The card is always square and the name is always an overlay revealed on
 * hover or keyboard focus — see `.pixl-card-name`. On touch the name is
 * reached by tapping through to the detail modal.
 *
 * The label is aria-hidden and the button carries the accessible name instead,
 * so a card announces its name once rather than twice. That also means touch
 * screen-reader users still get the name from the button itself.
 *
 * Takes `cells` separately from `icon` because the gallery may hand it
 * RECOLORED cells for display while `icon` stays the untouched registry record.

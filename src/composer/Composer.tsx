/**
 * The composer, as the blue Etch A Sketch (DESIGN.md §6).
 *
 * THE PAGE DOES NOT SCROLL. The toy is an object you hold, and an object that
 * runs off the bottom of the screen stops reading as one. Everything is sized
 * against the viewport: the frame takes the height that is left after the nav,
 * and the board takes its size from that height rather than from the width, so
 * a short window shrinks the board instead of growing the page.
 *
 * `composer-scope` is what makes the toy tokens resolve, and it is the ONLY
 * place they may (DESIGN.md §7). The dock below stays on the shell tokens: it
 * is a form about the drawing, not part of the object.

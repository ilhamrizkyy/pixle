/**
 * Composer editor state (INTERACTION.md §1–§5) — the layer between the engine
 * and the toy's UI.
 *
 * It owns what the owner is editing right now and delegates every change to an
 * engine op. There is deliberately NO grid maths in this file: an index
 * computed here instead of in `@/engine` is the first crack in the boundary
 * that lets the DOM/CSS-3D toy become the R3F toy later (TECH-STACK.md).
 *
 * TWO FIELDS FOR ONE DRAWING. `cells` is what the screen shows on the current
 * pointer frame; `history.present` is the last COMMITTED drawing. They hold the
 * same reference except while a gesture is in flight, and that is exactly what
 * makes "one mutating action = one undo step" (INTERACTION.md §2) fall out for
 * free: a drag paints into `cells` on every sample and only `endStroke`
 * commits. Because `history.present` is therefore always the pre-gesture
 * drawing, no gesture has to snapshot anything to be undoable.
 *
 * NOT A REACT MODULE, AND NOT A SINGLETON. This is vanilla zustand: the
 * presentation creates one store with `createComposerStore()` and reads it with
 * zustand's `useStore(store, selector)`. A module-level instance would be
 * shared by every server render and impossible to isolate between tests; a
 * factory is neither.

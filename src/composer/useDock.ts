/**
 * Everything the dock DOES, lifted out of how it looks.
 *
 * The dock wears two shapes — a single wide row on a desktop, a phone bar plus
 * a sheet below `lg` — and the save rules, the id checks and the import guard
 * must be identical in both. Holding them here is what makes that true by
 * construction rather than by remembering to edit twice.
 *
 * The file INPUT is deliberately not here. A ref that leaves the hook inside
 * its return value is a ref read during someone else's render, which React's
 * own lint rule rejects — so the element and the ref that clicks it stay in the
 * component that renders them, and only `importFile` lives here.
 *
 * REFUSALS LEAVE THROUGH THE SAME CHANNEL AS CONFIRMATIONS. They used to be a
 * line of state rendered inside the bar, which meant the bar changed height the
 * moment something went wrong — a floating toolbar growing upward into the toy
 * at exactly the moment you are trying to read it. As an error-toned toast the
 * message lands at the top of the screen, well clear of the dock it is about,
 * and the bar's geometry never moves.
 *
 * The tag DRAFT lives here for a related reason: below `lg` the tags field is
 * inside a sheet that unmounts on close, and state owned by the sheet would be
 * re-seeded from the kebab-cased store on every reopen — so "Arrow Right" would
 * come back as "arrow-right" under the cursor.
